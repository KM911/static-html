Once upon a time, a man kept a flock of sheep. One day, when he was about to grace his sheep, he found that a wolf had gotten through the sheepfold and taken one sheep away. 
	His neighbor suggested fixing the sheepfold to avoid the wolf coming again. However, he did not take care of that.
	The next day, the man found that the wolf had come again and captured another sheep. It reminded him that he should repair the sheepfold. From then on, sheep never got lost. 
	The story tells us that resolve the problem as soon as possible to avoid further loss.
